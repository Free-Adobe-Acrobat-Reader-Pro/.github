# Free Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro

Adobe Acrobat Pro is a powerful and comprehensive software designed for creating, editing, managing, and sharing PDF (Portable Document Format) documents. Unlike the free Adobe Acrobat Reader, which primarily focuses on viewing, printing, and basic annotation, Acrobat Pro offers an extensive suite of advanced tools catering to professionals and businesses with more complex document workflows.

It also includes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to turn scanned documents into editable and searchable PDFs.

- **Advanced Security Features**: Protect sensitive information with robust security options. This includes setting passwords, restricting permissions (like printing or editing), redacting sensitive content permanently, and applying encryption.
- **Electronic Signatures**: Collect legally binding e-signatures and track their progress. This streamlines document approval workflows.
- **Document Comparison**: Quickly compare two versions of a PDF to identify changes, making it ideal for reviewing contracts or collaborative documents.
